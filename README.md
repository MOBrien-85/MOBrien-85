# Michael O'Brien
I am a 2x Cancer-survivor, family man, and musician/cartoonist/writer.

I once hit a home run at a tournament in Cooperstown, NY and that ball was on display in the Baseball Hall of Fame.

I was once in a band that broke up while recording the album that would have made us famous (I know this because the remnants of that band went on to be on the cover of Rolling Stone and have songs in huge hollywood films and TV shows).

I used to write pop culture articles for no pay while I lived in NYC. I did get to meet and interview such celebrities as Kumail Nanjiani, Emily V. Gordon, Thomas Lennon, Robert Ben Garant, Neil deGrasse Tyson, Megan Duffy, and Carl Sagan's widow, Ann Druyan. 

I've published a few short stories (and a couple of poems) in both digital and print publications. Unfortunately, unless I plumb the depths of the internet archive, those websites no longer exist. These were published way back in 2007 or so. 

After we left Manhattan, we moved to the Washington D.C. area with our 5 month old son so my wife could begin her career as a corporate attorney. I moved into the role of Stay-At-Home-Dad. A role in which I happily raised our two kids for four years before returning to the workforce.
